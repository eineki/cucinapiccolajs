# cucinapiccolajs

A refactor of omnis studio intro tutorial cucina piccola in javascrip + react

I had to follow a tutorial for using a rapid develpment tool and I would like
to discover how hard and slower is recreate the same web app with react + nodejs

Hence, will not be deployment instructions, just directives on how recreate a
development setup with Vite & Express
